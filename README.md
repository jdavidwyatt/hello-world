I'm an OLD school html guy trying to learn new tricks. Know some css, trying to learrn scss. Also dabble a bit in WordPress, but I'm too lazy to learn PHP, Javascript, or jQuery. If it can't be done with html and css, I'm pretty lost. But I CAN follow directions, so if there's a good tutorial out there for what I want to do, I can probably get it done.
